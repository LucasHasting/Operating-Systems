# Operating-Systems
This repository holds all projects in my Operating Systems class. 

For the c++ programs, they were developed with the OpenBSD Operating System in mind.

The [RAG](RAG.pdf) file contains probelms involving a Resource Allocation Graph.

The [Algorithm Tracing](Algorithm_Tracing.pdf) file contains the tracing of scheduling algorithms. 

The [unash.cpp](unash.cpp) program is a basic shell.

The [sysprog.cpp](sysprog.cpp) program provides basic system information.

# C++ Installation and Usage

The programs in this repository can be executed using the C++ language and the g++ compiler.

g++ for [Windows](https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/), don't forget to add the binary to the [path environment variable](https://www.architectryan.com/2018/03/17/add-to-the-path-on-windows-10/).

g++ can be installed on Linux using your favorite package manager.
